Spicerack Changelog
-------------------

`v8.0.0`_ (2023-10-17)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* dhcp: the ``spicerack.Spicerack.dhcp()`` accessor has changed signature and now accepts just a datacenter name
  instead of ``RemoteHosts`` instance. All cookbooks using this accessor had the same logic implemented to find the
  specific dhcp hosts in a given datacenter and this logic has been moved inside the accessor. All existing usage
  will be migrated at deploy time.
* netbox: remove methods ``fetch_host_status``, ``fetch_host_detail`` and ``put_host_status`` that were deprecated
  since ``v0.0.50`` and replaced by the ``spicerack.netbox.NetboxServer`` class. Some private methods have also been
  renamed to follow more closely Netbox namings.

New features
""""""""""""

* Distributed locking support (`T341973`_):

  * See the dedicated :ref:`Distributed locking<distributed-locking>` section of the documentation for a general
    overview.
  * Cookbooks class API additions to the ``spicerack.cookbook.CookbookRunnerBase`` base class:

    * ``max_concurrency`` class property to statically set the maximum number of concurrent runs of a given cookbook,
      enforced by the distributed lock.
    * ``lock_ttl`` class property to statically set the TTL of the distributed lock acquired for each cookbook run.
    * ``lock_args`` instance property to dynamically modify the locking arguments, for example based on the CLI
      arguments (RO vs RW mode of operations).

  * Cookbooks module API additions:

    * ``MAX_CONCURRENCY`` module constant to statically set the maximum number of concurrent runs of a given cookbook,
      enforced by the distributed lock.
    * ``LOCK_TTL`` module constant to statically set the TTL of the distributed lock acquired for each cookbook run.

  * Automatically acquire a lock for each cookbook run according to the values defined above.
  * spicerack: add a ``_spicerack_lock`` private accessor to get a lock instance to be passed to the Spicerack modules
    that would need to acquire a distributed lock with concurrency and TTL. It is different from the public accessor
    for the cookbooks because the key prefix is different to keep cookbooks custom locks separate from the spicerack
    modules ones. It's mentioned here as information for Spicerack developers.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* dhcp: acquire exclusive per-DC lock on write operations:

  * Acquire an exclusive lock on a per-DC basis when performing write operations, both during the creation of a DHCP
    snippet and its deletion.
  * Always rewrite the DHCP snippet. With the protection of the lock, there is no more need for this check and the
    library can safely overwrite all the time the DHCP snippet for a given host.

* puppet: add support for puppetserver JSON commands returning non-zero exit code with JSON output (e.g. if a host is
  missing).

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* documentation: add new section for the distributed locking support in the Introduction page.
* documentation: mark the module interface as deprecated instead of having the class one as preferred, to better
  describe the current state.
* tox.ini: remove optimization for tox <4. Tox 4 will not re-use the environments because of the different names,
  so removing this tox <4 optimization as it's making subsequent runs slower with tox 4+.
* dhcp: simplify tests.
* tests: remove obsolete or not anymore needed items from the false positive list of unused code catched by vulture.

`v7.4.1`_ (2023-10-10)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* locking: load also ``~/.etcdrc`` for the running user (`T341973`_):

    * We currently save the authentication credential in ``/root/.etcdrc``. Generically load the effective running
      user's ``~/.etcdrc`` configuration file too and merge it into the one provided in the configuration. This is
      done best effort, if the ~/.etcdrc file is missing it will be silently ignored.

`v7.4.0`_ (2023-10-09)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New features
""""""""""""

* Add distribted locking support (`T341973`_):

  * locking: add new module for distributed locking support via etcd.
  * spicerack: add a new spicerack accessor ``lock()`` to get an instance of the locking class to acquire and release
    cookbook specific custom locks (`T341973`_).
  * cookbook: add ``--no-locks`` CLI argument to disable locking acquisition/release on a per-run basis. To be used in
    case of emergency or if there are issues with etcd that prevents to acquire/release locks properly.
  * By default the locking support is disabled unless the ``etcd_config`` is set in the configuration file.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* spicerack: add ``owner`` property to get a pre-formatted string of the form ``user@host [pid]`` useful to identify
  the owner of a current running process.
* spicerack: add ``current_hostname`` property to get the hostname of the host where the cookbook is currently running.
* spicerack: improve cookbooks help message:

  * The default argument parser in the CookbookBase class doesn't provide a ``prog`` name as it's a bit tricky to
    guess it because it depends on how many cookbooks are defined in a single file.
  * As a result the help message was not very clear up to now::

        $ sudo cookbook sre.hosts.decommission -h
        usage: cookbook [-h] -t TASK_ID [--force] query

  * With this release we inject the cookbook real name in the parser with the additional costruct to use::

        $ sudo cookbook sre.hosts.decommission -h
        usage: cookbook [GLOBAL_ARGS] sre.hosts.decommission [-h] -t TASK_ID [--force] query

  * This way it should also help to remind the user that there are global arguments for the cookbook binary in
    addition to the cookbook-specific ones. It was deemed not necessary to add a message to run ``cookbook -h`` to
    get the available ``GLOBAL_ARGS``, but it can be easily added.

`v7.3.1`_ (2023-10-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* tests: fix test that was actually querying the DNS making it fail in the Debian package build process.

`v7.3.0`_ (2023-10-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* puppet: Add new ``PuppetServer`` class and make the ``PuppetMaster`` inherit from it as it will be deprecated
  first and then removed in future releases.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* decorators: fix the ``set_tries()`` function (`T346134`_).

  * It is used to dynamically change the number of tries on a ``@retry``-decorated function/method but was not reading
    the function signature default value when present. Inspect the signature and if the default value is present, is an
    integer and is either untyped or typed as integer use it. Add also tests as they were not present and not spotted
    because the code coverage was considering the function as tested because used in the service module.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* tests: simplify the ``spicerack._cookbook.main()`` tests avoiding to mock the Spicerack instance and using instead
  the configuration file to instantiate a real instance.

`v7.2.2`_ (2023-09-11)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`v7.2.1`_ (2023-06-21)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* service: make the ``monitors`` field of the ``ServiceLVS`` class optional to adapt it to the recent change in Puppet
  about it.

`v7.2.0`_ (2023-05-31)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* ganeti: add new ``GanetiRAPI`` methods ``nodes()`` and ``groups()`` to get the related info from the cluster.
* ganeti: specify VM memory size in MB to allow for more fine-tune than GB.
* dhcp: when re-generating the DHCP includes and then restarting the DHCP server, in case of a failure make sure to
  delete the newly created snippet and refresh again to ensure the DHCP is in a good shape.
* dhcp: reword some exception messages.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* .gitignore: add local config files to it.
* Add Python 3.11 support.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* dhcp: expand support for hostname based match using the manufacturer to adapt to different settings.
* remote: improve usability of ``RemoteHosts.wait_reboot_since()`` clarifying the message and making it more DRY-RUN
  friendly.

`v7.0.0`_ (2023-05-08)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* spicerack: refactor IRC logging:

  * Rename the existing ``irc_logger`` to ``sal_logger`` as it logs to IRC with the ``!log`` and hence to SAL.
  * Add a new ``irc_logger`` property to log to IRC on the ``#wikimedia-operations`` channel without the ``!log``
    prefix to just log to IRC and not SAL.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* doc: do not load UI fix when building the manpage.

`v6.4.3`_ (2023-05-08)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* ganeti: enable ``--no-wait-for-sync`` by default for the virtual machine creation command.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* decorators: fix ``dry_run`` detection that had a bug in the case of a function with a ``dry_run`` argument with a
  default value. The default value was used also in the presence of a an explicit value set by the caller (`T335855`_).
* doc: fix search in documentation as ``jQuery`` is not automatically loaded by the rtd theme.
* doc: Remove extra preceding space in intro example.

`v6.4.2`_ (2023-04-17)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* kafka: remove setting to avoid checking the hostname in TLS certs as all clusters in production are now running
  with PKI TLS certs that have the hostname in their CN.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

`v6.4.0`_ (2023-03-28)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* tox: make config compatible with tox ``4.x``.
* remote: add results to ``RemoteExecutionError``. While waiting for Cumin to support a more robust result reporting,
  pass the results also in the case of a failed execution to the ``RemoteExecutionError`` excepion so that potentially
  client code could access the partial results on failure using a pattern like::

      try:
          results = remote_hosts.run_sync('some command')
      except RemoteExecutionError as e:
          results = e.results

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* setup.py: force ``dnspython`` from Bullseye pinning the dependency to the same version of Debian Bullseye as
  upstream has breaking changes also between minor versions.
* dnsdisc: adapt code and tests to work with ``dnspython 2.0.0``.
* service: improve ``check_dns_state`` validation check.
* puppet: make the ``PuppetMaster`` class inherit from ``RemoteHostsAdapter`` to fix a bug in dry-run mode with
  a method decorated with ``@retry``.
* service: ensure that ``dry_run`` is passed to the ``Service`` class to be detected in dry-run mode for methods
  decorated with ``@retry``.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* tox: use ``sphinx-build`` to generate the documentation, this prevents a deprecation warning for using ``setup.py``.

`v6.3.0`_ (2023-03-15)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New features
""""""""""""

* apt: add new module with new ``AptGetHosts`` class that inherits from ``RemoteHostsAdapter`` to handle simple
  ``apt-get`` use cases but setting all the proper options for non-interactive runs of ``apt-get``.
* spicerack: add new ``spicerack.apt_get()`` accessor to run ``apt-get`` commands on target hosts.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* redfish: add simple supermicro class.
* alertmanager: match also FQDN, not only hostnames in the label.
* decorators: add ``set_tries()`` function to be used for the ``dynamic_params_callbacks`` argument of the ``@retry``
  decorator to dynamically modify the number of tries to retry from the client.
* dnsdisc: add a ``resolve_with_client_ip()`` method to resolve with EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) support.
* service: extend the discovery capabilities of the service catalog to check the DNS records with ECS support adding
  a ``check_service_ips()`` method and a ``check_dns_state()`` one.
* spicerack: add ``authdns_active_hosts`` property to get a ``RemoteHosts`` instance for the authoritative DNS servers
  currently active. As it uses the Cumin's direct backend it works also if PuppetDB is not available.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* icinga: handle edge case where status is not optimal but there are no failed services (`T330318`_).
* icinga: uniform code for acked services like failed services to offer the same API in all involved classes.
* k8s: fix existing docstrings.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* tox: disable bandit's ``request_without_timeout`` in tests.
* setup.py: bump dependencies minimum version to match those in Debian bullseye.
* setup.py: remove temporary upper limit for prospector as the upstream issue has been fixed.
* doc: dynamically set copyright year to current year.
* Use ``GenericAlias`` objects for type hints in the whole code base given that the lowest supported Python is 3.9:

  * Use directly ``GenericAlias`` builtin objects for type hints (e.g. ``dict[]`` instead of ``Dict[]``).
  * Use directly ``GenericAlias`` objects from the ``collections.abc`` module instead of the ones from the ``typing``
    module (i.e. ``collections.abc.Sequence`` instead of ``typing.Sequence``).
  * See also `PEP 585`_.

* docstrings: automatically document type hints using ``sphinx_autodoc_typehints``. Now it's not necessary to repeat
  in the docstrings the type of the variables and return types as those are automatically added reading the type hints
  present in the signature. The whole code base has been updated accordingly.

`v6.2.2`_ (2023-02-23)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* icinga: fix condition that determines if a service status is failed or not (`T330318`_).

`v6.2.0`_ (2023-02-20)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Internal API breaking changes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* spicerack: get authdns servers from config file (`T329773`_):

  * The list of all authdns servers was retrieved via the cumin alias ``A:dns-auth``, which itself comes from Puppet
    resources (query ``P{R:Class = profile::dns::auth}``).
  * This leads to cookbooks using dnsdisc or service modules failing whenever and authdns is unavailable for
    maintenance.
  * The source of truth for active authdns servers is hiera, so refactor the modules to use a configuration file
    populated by Puppet instead.
  * Using the configuration file from Puppet also removes the need to query the IP of the DNS servers and allows to use
    the Discovery class also withouth a fully working DNS.
  * Use keywords only for most parameters of the touched classes.
  * This change breaks the internal spicerack APIs while the cookbook-facing Spicerack class API has been left
    untouched.

New features
""""""""""""

* alertmanager: add parent ``Alertmanager`` class:

  * In some use cases we need to silence alerts in alertmanager that are not attached to any host via the ``instance``
    label.
  * In order to do so abstract away a higher level ``Alertmanager`` class with the generic bits to interact with the
    Alertmanager APIs and make the existing ``AlertmanagerHosts`` class a derived class of that one.
  * Add a new Spicerack accessor ``alertmanager()`` to get an instance of a generic Alertmanager without relations to
    hosts.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* icinga: allow ``wait_for_optimal`` to ignore acknowledged alerts (`T319277`_).
* redfish: allow for refreshing the manager info. Some of the iDRAC info such as firmware and BIOS version are more
  dynamic and as such we gather them every time, however some other data such as the model is fairly static and can
  benefit from being cached. As such update the interface so that we can refresh the specific data block for functions
  that need to.
* redfish: add upload/update methods to push firmware upgrades.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* mysql_legacy: remove ``x2`` handling logic as it's read-write in both datacenters, and actively written to.
  Remove it from the module's logic completely to avoid confusion and desync with cumin's list of core-db.

`v6.1.0`_ (2023-02-10)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* puppet: allow to specify the exact message when disabling/enabling puppet.
* config: expand user's home (``~``) for logs dir.
* cookbook: improve help message.
* redfish: move Dell specific functionalities to the Dell class.
* redfish: store all OOB info for later use.
* redfish: add ``system_manager`` info and properties for ``bios_version``, ``model``, ``manufacturer``.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* Fix incorrect usage of ClusterShell's ``NodeSet`` using the Cumin's ``nodeset`` and ``nodeset_fromlist`` instead.

`v6.0.0`_ (2022-12-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* The ``cookbooks_base_dir`` config key has been renamed to ``cookbooks_base_dirs`` and must be a list of paths.

New features
""""""""""""

* Add support for multiple cookbooks paths to be loaded. All the cookbooks paths must have a directory inside named
  ``cookbooks/`` and this directory must not have an ``__init__.py`` file as Namespace Packages are used (see
  `PEP 420`_) (`T325168`_).

* Add module injection support (`T319401`_):

  * Add an optional configuration key ``external_modules_dir`` to define an external modules directory that will be
    injected in the Python path to allow to use also external modules not present in spicerack.
  * Add a new ``spicerack.SpicerackExtenderBase`` class to inherit from in order to define an external accessor class
    that will be used by Spicerack to allow to use external accessors.
  * Add an optional configuration key ``extender_class`` in the ``instance_params`` configuration key for specifying
    the fully qualified name of the Python class to use as the extender class.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* setup.py: Add ``python_requires`` metadata. The latest pyroma does check for its presence and it makes sense to add
  it to prevent from installing the spicerack package on the wrong Python version.
* setup.py: Revert old upper limit for ``GitPython``, there are no more issue with more recent versions.
* setup.py: Set an upper limit for ``pylint`` and ``prospector`` for upstream issues.
* setup.py: Split the python auto-formatter test dependencies on their own extra group so that they can be installed
  alone in the already split virtual environment for the tox envs ``py3-style`` and ``py3-format``. This way there are
  no conflicts between other test dependencies and ``black`` and ``isort``.
* setup.py: Add specific style tox environments for each Python version to avoid the CI jobs to pick Python 3.7 that
  has a pip backtracking issue with the latest versions of the dependencies. Keep the ``py3-{style,format}``
  environments for ease of use locally and to not break compatibility but make the ``py3-style`` one not run
  automatically in CI.

`v5.0.2`_ (2022-11-17)

Dependencies breaking changes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Starting with Spicerack v5.0.0 the support for Python 3.7 and 3.8 is dropped. For now there are no breaking changes
  but it's not guaranteed to work with those versions anymore.

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* constants: remove ``CORE_DATACENTERS`` constant:

  * Remove the constant from Spicerack as it's a duplicate of the one already present in ``wmflib``.
  * Convert all Spicerack code to use the same variable from ``wmflib``.
  * All the cookbooks have been already migrated to use the ``wmflib`` one.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* ipmi: clarify that the target can also be an IP address. The ipmi module works the same as with a management FQDN.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* netbox: update allowed state transitions:

  * As the way we use Netbox status is changed as part of the work in `T320696`_ and the ``staged`` status is not
    anymore used, update the allowed transitions based on the new `Server Lifecycle Diagram`_.

* mypy: remove upper limit and refactor mypy configuration to properly work with newer versions.

`v4.0.0`_ (2022-09-28)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* redfish: use the management IP instead of FQDN to connect to the management console:

  * Some DELL hosts come with the ``idrac.webserver.HostHeaderCheck`` setting set to ``1``, that prevents to connect
    to the Redfish API unless the hostname is set in the configuration, creating a chicken and egg problem to automate
    the initial setup of the hosts.
  * To prevent this switch the whole module to use directly IPs for now. We might want to improve this later setting
    the hostname in the iDRAC settings and then switching to use the FQDN once that is configured, but because most of
    the automation will be already done by that time it's not clear if it would be a real win.
  * [BREAKING API] this changes the ``spicerack.Spicerack.redfish()`` signature to require a hostname instead of a
    management FQDN and also makes the username parameter optional, defaulting to use ``root``.
  * [BREAKING API] this changes the ``spicerack.redfish.Redfish`` class signature to require a hostname and management
    IP address instead of a single parameter with the FQDN. Although breaking, no cookbook usage should instantiate
    this class directly, but always via the above accessor.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* icinga: add explicit support of the DRY-RUN mode (`T315537`_):

  * While the DRY-RUN compatibility of the ``icinga`` module was guaranteed by the ``remote`` module, there was a
    usage of the ``@retry`` decorator that wasn't able to detect when in DRY-RUN mode and accordingly reduce the
    number of retries.

* Bump ``pynetbox`` dependency to ``~= 6.6`` (`T310745`_).

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* redfish: add support to check the reboot of the DELL iDRACs:

  * add a ``most_recent_member()`` method in the ``Redfish`` class to return the most recent message from an API reply
    with members from Dell.
  * add a ``last_reboot()`` method to the ``Redfish`` class to get the time of the last DELL iDRAC reboot.
  * add a ``wait_reboot_since()`` method to the ``Redfish`` class to poll until the DELL iDRAC comes back online after
    a reboot.

* redfish: add property for the ``HttpPushURI`` url, needed for pushing firmware to the DELL iDRACs.
* redfish: add a ``generation`` property to the ``Redfish`` class to represent the DELL iDRAC genration i.e.
  ``13`` == ``idrac8``, ``14`` == ``idrac9``, and allow us to implment workarounds for older generations.
* redfish: add a ``fqdn()`` getter property and ``__str__()`` method to the ``Redfish`` class:

  * When passing around a ``Redfish`` instance it's useful to know what host it represents as such add a getter for
    the FQDN property and update the ``__str__()`` metbod to also return the FQDN.

* k8s: Add ``KubernetesNode.taints`` propertry to return the taints of a node.
* k8s: Retry checks for expected pods on drain as in some cases (e.g. pods not catching ``TERM``) it might take a while
  for pods to actually terminate. Retry the check for expeced pods to reduce the chance for errors.
* k8s: Retry pod evictions on ``HTTP 429`` from API server:

  * An ``HTTP 429`` response from the API server means that the eviction is not currently allowed because of a
    configured ``PodDisruptionBudget`` or a API server rate limit was hit. Retry ``evict()`` calls in both cases 3
    times with exponential backoff.

* tests: reduce runtime by more than 80%:

  * The logging module setup performed in the ``spicerack._log.setup_logging()`` function is not automatically reset by
    pytest, leading to slowness in some tests, in particular those with a lot of output, for example due to a lot of
    retries.
  * Add a ``_reset_logging_module()`` funtion in the tests for the ``_log`` module that removes all exisiting filters
    and handlers to both the root and the IRC loggers.
  * Call the ``_reset_logging_module()`` function in the teardown of every test that directly or indirectly calls the
    ``spicerack._log.setup_logging()`` function.
  * This reduces the runtime of the unit tests by more than 80%, in my local environment for example it went from ~150s
    to ~25s for the 825 tests run.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* redfish: better compare Dell SCP attributes:

  * When comparing Dell SCP attributes for the configuration, consider them identical if they are a comma-separated
    list both if the separator is just the comma or comma+space. Some versions of iDRAC return the values comma+space

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* ganeti: refactor the Ganeti module to support the new data model in Netbox:

  * With the new representation of Ganeti data in Netbox, the hardcoded matching between cluster names and Ganeti
    RAPI FQDN endpoint would not work anymore.
  * Refactor the module to gather the data directly from Netbox.
  * This requires the addition of a custom field ``ip_address`` for the virtualization cluster groups model that
    connects it to the Ganeti RAPI VIP "svc" DNS name that is assigned to the related IP address in Netbox.
    The custom field has been already added and populated in Netbox in production.
  * The main benefit is the removal of the hardcoded mapping between clusters and their groups (rows/racks).
  * Add a new ``get_cluster()`` and ``get_group()`` methods in the ``Ganeti`` class to get a new ``GanetiCluster``
    or ``GanetiGroup`` dataclass instances that represent the data required to identify the related resources.
  * Removed the hardcoded magic logic that mapped a row ``A`` to a Ganeti group ``row_A`` as we're moving away from
    row-level redundancy at the network layer towards a rack-level redundancy model. This allows to rename the Ganeti
    groups at anytime freely.

    managment FQDN of a host given its hostname (`T240176`_).
  * The class also allow to update the device status only if it's a physical host and the status transition is approved.

* cookbook API: add class API

  * In addition to the simple cookbooks function API interface add support for a more integrated class-based API.
  * Spicerack will perform auto-detection of the API used by the cookbook and automatically convert the module-based
    API cookbooks into class-based cookbooks so that only one interface is actually supported internally.
  * The class API defines a ``CookbookBase`` class that cookbooks that want to use this API must extend creating a
    derived class. The derived class can have any name. Multiple cookbooks in the same module are supported.
  * The class-based API allows a more in-depth integration with Spicerack:

    * Allow to perform additional initialization and validation steps in the class constructor before the cookbook
      execution starts, allowing the cookbook to bail out before execution and any related ``!log-ging``.
    * Allow to define a custom runtime description that will be included, for example, in the ``START/END`` logging
      messages that are also sent to IRC and ``!log-ed`` into SAL.
    * Refactor the Cookbook API documentation to be more detailed and following Sphinx standards to document the
      cookbooks module interfaces.
    * Refactor out from the private ``_cookbook`` module some functionalities to a ``_menu`` and ``_module_api``
      modules.

* spicerack: add ``requests_session`` accessor to get a requests's ``Session`` pre-configured by ``wmflib`` with a
  default timeout, retry logic and ``User-Agent``.
* decorators: Add an optional custom failure message to ``@retry``:

  * The ``@retry`` decorator logs the messages from exceptions raised during execution, but when there are chained
    exceptions ("raise from", etc.) only the top-level error is logged. For example, in ``MediaWiki._check_siteinfo``,
    we only log ``Failed to get siteinfo`` and throw away the message from the underlying ``RequestException``.
    Instead, this traverses the exception chain (using the same logic as the built-in default handler for uncaught
    exceptions) and includes each exception's message in the log entry.

Minor improvements

  * Add initial support for ``gnt-* commands`` to be executed on the cluster master via remote execution.
  * Add initial support for ``gnt-instance`` commands to perform Ganeti VMs decommissioning, in particular:

    * ``shutdown``: to shutdown a Ganeti VM, with its optional ``timeout`` parameter.
