Spicerack Changelog
-------------------

`v1.0.0`_ (2021-09-22)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* remote: remove ``RemoteHosts.init_system()`` method:

  * As systemd is used by all hosts and this method is not used in any cookbook, remove it completely as it's no longer
    needed.

New features
""""""""""""

* remote: add support to enable/disable Cumin output:

  * Add support to suppress Cumin's output and progress bars independently to the ``RemoteHosts`` and
    ``LBRemoteCluster`` classes.
  * Add a ``print_output`` and ``print_progress_bars`` boolean parameters to ``run_sync()``, ``run_async()`` and
    ``run()`` methods to independently print Cumin's output and progress bars respectively.
  * Add a simplified ``verbose`` parameter to the more higher level methods ``restart_services()`` and
    ``reload_services()`` that when set to ``False`` will suppress both output and progress bars at once.
  * Add just the ``print_progress_bars`` parameter for the high level methods ``wait_reboot_since()`` and ``uptime()``.
  * All the new parameters default to ``True`` right now to keep the existing behaviour, to be changed to ``False`` in
    a future release.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* icinga: reduce verbosity of Cumin's output, taking advantage of the new parameters to control the output of Cumin's
  commands.
* puppet: reduce verbosity of Cumin's output, taking advantage of the new parameters to control the output of Cumin's
  commands.
* dhcp: reduce verbosity of Cumin's output, taking advantage of the new parameters to control the output of Cumin's
  commands.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

ipmi: improve dry-run mode for ``force_pxe()``:

* When ``force_pxe()`` can't verify that the next boot will indeed be via PXE it raises an exception. Convert that
  into a warning logging message when in DRY-RUN mode to let the cookbooks continue the DRY-RUN.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* versioning: moving Spicerack releases to a semantic versioning schema.
* management: deprecate the ``Management`` class:

  * As its only purpose was to get the management FQDN of a host, given that the same functionality is now provided
    by the netbox module via the ``NetboxServer`` class and its ``mgmt_fqdn`` and ``asset_tag_fqdn`` properties,
    deprecate the class for a subsequent removal.

* confctl: fix example code in docstring.
* pylint: fix newly reported issues.
* docs: add how to contribute section.

`v0.0.59`_ (2021-09-09)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* ipmi: refactor class signature

  * API breaking change, but the ``Spicerack.ipmi()`` accessor is used only in the ``sre.hosts.decommission`` and
    ``sre.hosts.ipmi-password-reset cookbooks``, so it should be trivial to change both at once.
  * Convert the IPMI class to require the FQDN of the management console to target, to avoid the need to pass that
    around both from the client and internally in the class.
  * The caching of the management password is done transparently by the ``Spicerack.ipmi()`` accessor to avoid the
    anoyance of being asked the management password for each host.

* dhcp: small refactor (the module is still unused)

  * Rename ``switch_port`` to ``switch_iface`` to avoid confusions.
  * Rename the context manager from ``dhcp_push()`` to ``config()`` as it's more natural to use:
    ``with dhcp.config(my_config): # do something``
  * Simplify formatting of templates, added ignores to vulture for false positives
  * Add constructor documentation to the dataclasses.

* icinga: remove the deprecated ``Icinga`` class

  * The Icinga class has been deprecated for a while now and it's time to remove it completely. No cookbook is using
    it anymore.


New features
""""""""""""

* remote: add support for the installer key

  * When instantiating a ``remote()`` instance, allow to pass a new parameter ``installer``, defaulted to ``False``,
    that when ``True`` will use the special installer key for the remote instances that allow to connect to the
    Debian installer environment or a freshly installed host prior to its first Puppet run.

* ipmi: add status and reboot capabilities:

  * Add a new method ``power_status()`` that returns the current power status and is also used by the existing
    ``check_connection()`` method.
  * Add a new method ``reboot()`` to issue an IPMI power on or power cycle, based on the current status of the device.

* netbox: add getter ``asset_tag_fqdn`` for the asset tag mgmt FQDN property.
* icinga: add ``downtime_services()`` and ``remove_service_downtimes()`` and also a ``services_downtimed()`` context
  manager to allow to downtime only the host services that matches the given regex.


Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* puppet: minor improvements

  * Return the results from the ``Puppet.first_run()`` method to allow to save it to a file like the current reimage
    script does.
  * Add an accessor for the ``master_host`` property in the ``PuppetMaster`` class as this is created and instantiated
    by Spicerack and was hidden from the user of the API.

* decorators: migrate to the wmflib version of ``@retry`` (`T257905`_)

  * Use the wmflib version of ``@retry`` while keeping the dry-run awareness and default to catching ``SpicerackError``
    instead of ``WmflibError`` like the pre-exsiting version was doing.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* code style: migrate all the usage of string ``format()`` to f-strings.
* pylint: addressed newly reported pylint issues and removed unnecessary disable comments.
* prospector: disable ``E203`` for pep-8 over black.
* code style: if there are no local modifications check last commit instead of not checking anything.

`v0.0.58`_ (2021-08-25)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New features
""""""""""""

* Class API: add ``rollback()`` method

  * Add a new ``rollback()`` method to the ``CookbookRunnerBase`` base class that by default does nothing.
  * The method is called by Spicerack when a cookbook exits with a non-zero exit code or raises an un-caught exception.
  * This allows cookbooks to define their own cleanup strategy in case of errors, for example to restore a previously
    coherent state.
  * Any exception raised by the ``rollback()`` method will be caught and logged by Spicerack with its original exit
    code and will then exit with a reserved exit code for a failed rollback.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* mediawiki: remove cron-specific maintenance implementation details, replaced by systemd timers (`T289078`_).

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* icinga: use shlex to quote the command string for bash (`T288558`_).

  * This fixes the downtiming that would fail if the admin reason contains an apostrophe, due to lack of escaping.

* mediawiki: ignore php-fpm when stopping cronjobs (`T285804`_).

  * On mwmaint, php-fpm is used to serve noc.wikimedia.org so we want to keep it running even when stopping cronjobs.

`v0.0.57`_ (2021-08-02)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* dnsdisc: improved message logged explicitely saying what was checked and what didn't match when checking that a
  discovery record has been updated (`T285706`_).
* icinga: adapt to the newer API of the ``icinga-status`` output.
* icinga: write directly to the Icinga command file instead of calling the ``icinga-downtime`` wrapper script where
  it was used so that the whole module now interacts directly with the Icinga command file. This opens up the route
  for further improvements (`T285803`_).
* ganeti: add ganeti test cluster to the possible Ganeti locations (`T286206`_).
* mysql_legacy: re-add ``x2`` database section and add support for active/active core sections (`T285519`_).

  * ``get_core_dbs()`` now supports excluding sections from its cumin query. All of the functions that call it in
    the context of setting the database read-only or read-write will now exclude sections listed in
    ``ACTIVE_ACTIVE_SECTIONS``.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* puppet: when regenerating the client certificate, do not rely on the exit code of the Puppet command as it might be
  misleading. It already relies on successfully finding the certificate fingerprint.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* tox: remove ``flake8-import-order`` plugin as dependency now that the import order is ensured by ``black`` and
  ``isort``.

`v0.0.56`_ (2021-06-26)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* mediawiki: reverted the change of v0.0.55 to make siteinfo API request over HTTPS.
* mediawiki: remove unnecessary and broken disable of systemd timers added in version v0.0.55.
* mysql_legacy: reverted the change of v0.0.49 to add the new ``x2`` database core section (`T285519`_).

`v0.0.55`_ (2021-06-24)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* mediawiki: Update cronjob code now that most are systemd timers.

  * Removed ``check_cronjobs_enabled()``.
  * Renamed ``stop_cronjobs()`` to ``stop_periodic_jobs()``.
  * Added ``check_periodic_jobs_disabled()``, ``check_periodic_jobs_enabled()`` and
    ``check_systemd_timers_enabled()``.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* mediawiki: Make siteinfo API request over HTTPS.

`v0.0.54`_ (2021-06-21)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* icinga: rename some ``IcingaHosts`` methods:

  * This is an API breaking change, but the newly introduced ``IcingaHosts`` API is not yet used widely, just one
    Cookbook uses it so far.
  * Rename some methods of the ``IcingaHosts`` class to be more dry and explicit. Namely:
    * ``hosts_downtimed`` -> ``downtimed`` (context manager)
    * ``downtime_hosts`` -> ``downtime``
    * ``host_command`` -> ``run_icinga_command``

`v0.0.53`_ (2021-06-10)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* icinga: use bash wrapper to allow sudo in the ``IcingaHosts`` class.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* doc: use ``add_css_file()`` instead of ``add_stylesheet()``.
* doc: fix parameter type in docstring.

`v0.0.52`_ (2021-05-06)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New features
""""""""""""

* dhcp: Add module for manipulating dynamic DHCP entries on target data centers and restarting the DHCP server
  (`T269855`_).
* icinga: pass ``verbatim_hosts`` option to the ``icinga-status`` script when using verbatim Icinga hostnames that
  are not real hosts.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

*  netbox: fix check for server role.

  * The physical devices and virtual machines objects in Netbox have different names for the role property
    (``device_role`` vs ``role``). Use the correct property each time.

* icinga: fix typo in docstring.

`v0.0.51`_ (2021-05-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* dnsdisc: do not configure DNS resolver. As the module is injecting the nameservers of the authoritative DNS, do not
  let the DNS module auto-configure itself with ``/etc/resolv.conf``.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* tests: fix mock of the DNS module that was not in some cases properly mocked and the tests were relying on a properly
  configured ``/etc/resolv.conf``.

`v0.0.50`_ (2021-05-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dependencies breaking changes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* setup.py: relax elasticsearch dependencies:

  * In order to be able to build spicerack for Debian bullseye that ships ``python3-elasticsearch`` ``7.1.0`` and
    ``python3-elasticsearch-curator`` ``5.8.1``, relax the related dependency constraints in ``setup.py``.
  * Elasticsearch requires to bump the version above the suggested compatibility matrix, we'll test if all works as
    expected. See the `elasticsearch compatibility matrix`_.
  * Elasticsearch curator matches upstream compatibility matrix, see the `elasticsearch curator compatibility matrix`.
  * As Spicerack is released via debian packages this will not affect the buster builds.

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* netbox: improve ``as_dict()``:

  * Instead of calling ``serialize()`` for the conversion to dictionary, just calling ``dict()`` on the object gives a
    more useful representation of the object because all the nested properties are converted to string or
    sub-dictionaries with useful values instead of just the IDs.
  * As a result any usage of ``as_dict()`` that relied on the format of specific fields might break. At the moment no
    cookbook is using it.
  * See also the "Casting the object as a dictionary" example in `pynetbox.core.response.Record`_.

New features
""""""""""""

* netbox: add ``NetboxServer`` class:

  * Add a ``NetboxServer`` class in the netbox module to give a higher level abstraction across physical servers and
    virtual machines.
  * This is particularly useful to finally have an authoritative way to convert a hostname into a FQDN or get the
    managment FQDN of a host given its hostname (`T240176`_).
  * The class also allow to update the device status only if it's a physical host and the status transition is approved.
  * Those new features will be used by the cookbook that will replace the reimage script and then the current usage of
    some of the existing methods in the ``Netbox`` class should be converted to use this class instead.

* icinga: add new ``IcingaHosts`` class (`T277740`_):

  * Implements the TODO that wanted to move the ``Icinga`` class into a class that is initialized with the target hosts
    so that it's not necessary anymore to pass them to each method.
  * Keep the existing ``Icinga`` class for now, but mark it as deprecated, both in the documentation of
    ``spicerack.Spicerack.icinga()`` and ``icinga.Icinga()`` and emit also a ``DeprecationWarning`` when instantiated.
    It will be removed in the next release once all the cookbooks have been migrated to the new
    ``spicerack.Spicerack.icinga_hosts()`` accessor.
  * Move the detection of the Icinga command file to its own class to allow to cache it across different instances,
    making the instantiation of multiple ``IcingaHosts`` class free after the first one.
  * Allow to manage also non-servers that are defined as Icinga hosts passing the ``verbatim_hosts`` parameter, that
    will not extract the hostname from the given hosts assuming that they are already FQDNs.

* toolforge.etcdctl: Allow getting the cluster health. This opens up being able to wait/stop if the cluster status is
  not what's expected when doing operations (`T276338`_).

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* icinga: use a bash command wrapper to allow sudo, otherwise the echo command will fail to output to the file.
* icinga: use a sudo-friendly command to detect the Icinga ``command_file``.
* netbox: improve ``as_dict()``:

  * Instead of calling ``serialize()`` for the conversion to dictionary, just calling ``dict()`` on the object gives a
    more useful representation of the object because all the nested properties are converted to string or
    sub-dictionaries with useful values instead of just the IDs.
  * See also the "Casting the object as a dictionary" example in `pynetbox.core.response.Record`_.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* remote: fix ``use_sudo`` on ``split()``.
* netbox: fix object type returned for status. The status should be returned as string and not as a Netbox object.
* doc: add documentation for the toolforge package.
* doc: remove obsolete configuration
* setup.py: add missing tag for Python 3.9, already supported.
* tests: fix pip backtracking separating the prospector tests into its own virtualenv.
* tests: fix format checking

  * If no Python files were modified at all, the latest isort would bail out. Skipping the checks if no Python files
    were modified at all.

* doc: fix documentation checker for sub-packages

  * The existing checker was assuming a flat space of modules inside spicerack, while now we have also subpackages.
    Adapt the checker to detect those too.
  * Convert file operations to pathlib.

`v0.0.49`_ (2021-03-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* icinga: changed the type for the ``hosts`` parameter in the ``get_status()`` method from
  ``spicerack.typing.TypeHosts`` to ``cumin.NodeSet``.

New features
""""""""""""

* icinga: add ``Icinga.wait_for_optimal()`` method to pause while hosts converge to an optimal state.
* puppet: add ``Puppet.get_ca_servers()`` method to retrieve the configured Puppet ``ca_server`` on the target hosts.
* remote: allow prepending every command to execute on the target hosts with sudo. This is a first temporary iteration
  until Cumin will support it natively.
* toolforge.etcdctl: add new toolforge package with an etcdctl module to run etcdctl commands and retrieve a parsed
  output. Focused on etcd member management only for now (`T267412`_).

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* config: allow to use paths relative to the user's ``$HOME`` directory expanding ``~``.
* logging: improve logging format

  * Add the ``DRY-RUN`` prefix also to file logs to allow to distinguish dry-run executions from the real ones just
    looking at the logs.
  * Improve the execute cookbook log message including the whole arguments so that it includes also the global args
    such as ``verbose`` and ``dry-run``.

* remote: ``RemoteHosts.wait_reboot_since()`` is now using a constant backoff. Previously, a linear backoff with a base
  delay of 10 seconds was used. Since we do expect the reboot of a server to take some time, by the time the server has
  rebooted, the retry interval has already grown to multiple minutes. A constant backoff should be appropriate
  and should increase the reactivity of this check significantly.
* mysql_legacy.py: Add the new ``x2`` database core section (`T269324`_).

Bug fixes
"""""""""

* cookbooks: force the title to be one line. When reading the title from the cookbooks, pick only the first line to
  prevent the UI to be cluttered by a title erroneously set to multi-line.

* documentation: add a development page to highlight how the code is formatted and how to integrate the code formatters
  with an editor/IDE or in the git workflow (`T211750`_).
* git: allow exclude code auto formatters refactor commit from git blame adding the ``.git-blame-ignore-revs`` file.

* logging: fix base path and name to setup logging.

  * In the recent refactor to the new APIs, the paths passed to the setup_logging function were not anymore correct.

`v0.0.47`_ (2021-01-13)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* Use newly migrated code from wmflib:

  * Some additional functionalites were moved to wmflib (>= 0.0.5), remove the duplicated code from Spicerack and use
    the wmflib version instead.
  * interactive: convert all imports to use the wmflib version, remove the duplicated code. The module is for now left
    to hold the ``get_management_password()`` function.
  * prometheus: moved entirely to wmflib.
  * _log: use the SAL (!log) IRC handler from wmflib.
  * The ``@retry`` decorator will be migrated in a separate patch to keep its dry-run awareness.

API breaking changes
""""""""""""""""""""

* Removed config and phabricator modules migrated to wmflib and update imports.
* remote: re-enabled Cumin's output removing its suppression. The work on `T212783`_ will make it more flexible on
  a per-execution basis, but for now is better to just re-enable it and make the errors surface to the users.

New features
""""""""""""

* cookbook API: add class API

  * In addition to the simple cookbooks function API interface add support for a more integrated class-based API.
  * Spicerack will perform auto-detection of the API used by the cookbook and automatically convert the module-based
    API cookbooks into class-based cookbooks so that only one interface is actually supported internally.
  * The class API defines a ``CookbookBase`` class that cookbooks that want to use this API must extend creating a
    derived class. The derived class can have any name. Multiple cookbooks in the same module are supported.
  * The class-based API allows a more in-depth integration with Spicerack:

    * Allow to perform additional initialization and validation steps in the class constructor before the cookbook
      execution starts, allowing the cookbook to bail out before execution and any related ``!log-ging``.
    * Allow to define a custom runtime description that will be included, for example, in the ``START/END`` logging
      messages that are also sent to IRC and ``!log-ed`` into SAL.
    * Refactor the Cookbook API documentation to be more detailed and following Sphinx standards to document the
      cookbooks module interfaces.
    * Refactor out from the private ``_cookbook`` module some functionalities to a ``_menu`` and ``_module_api``
      modules.

* spicerack: add ``requests_session`` accessor to get a requests's ``Session`` pre-configured by ``wmflib`` with a
  default timeout, retry logic and ``User-Agent``.
* decorators: Add an optional custom failure message to ``@retry``:

  * The ``@retry`` decorator logs the messages from exceptions raised during execution, but when there are chained
    exceptions ("raise from", etc.) only the top-level error is logged. For example, in ``MediaWiki._check_siteinfo``,
    we only log ``Failed to get siteinfo`` and throw away the message from the underlying ``RequestException``.
    Instead, this traverses the exception chain (using the same logic as the built-in default handler for uncaught
    exceptions) and includes each exception's message in the log entry.

Minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""

* Convert all usage of the ``requests`` package to use the ``wmflib.requests.http_session`` instead to have a nice
  ``User-Agent``, a default timeout and a retry logic on some failures across ``Spicerack``.
* puppet: suppress deprecation warnings.
* decorators: Log chained exception messages in ``@retry``.

Miscellanea
"""""""""""

* doc: add missing link to the ``wmflib`` package.
* dependencies: remove temporary hacks.
* dependencies: update min version to match the versions in Debian Buster.
* tests: remove ``require_*`` decorators.
* Refactoring: renamed internal modules with a leading underscore:

  * Moved ``cookbook.py`` to ``_cookbook.py`` and ``log.py`` to ``_log.py`` as all their content is actually internal
    to ``spicerack`` and no client should use any of that. They were already excluded from the generated documentation
    for the same purpose.

  * The ``Actions`` instances allow to keep track of actions performed by acookbook with the following features:

    * Save the message of the action with different levels (``success``, ``warning``, ``failure``).
    * Log the message of the action with the associated log level.
    * Keep track of the presence of any warning or failure.
    * Have a nice string representation of the actions, suitable to be used to update a Phabricator task.

  * The ``ActionsDict`` class has too a nice string representation of its items.
  * This is a porting with some generalization of the code present in the `sre.hosts.decommission`_ cookbook.
  * Pre-create an ``ActionsDict`` instance in spicerack so that it can be accessed in the cookbooks directly as
    ``spicerack.actions``.

* typing: add a ``typing`` module for custom type hints:

  * Add a new typing module to hold all custom types useful across Spicerack.
  * Define a custom type ``TypeHosts`` that can be either a ``NodeSet`` or a sequence of strings.
  * Use the new type in the icinga module.
