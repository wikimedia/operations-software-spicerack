Cookbooks API
-------------

Collection of cookbooks to automate and orchestrate operations in the WMF infrastructure.
The cookbooks will be executed by the ``cookbook`` entry point script of the ``spicerack`` package.

Cookbooks hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cookbooks must be structured in a tree, as they can be run also from an interactive menu that shows the tree from
an arbitrary entry point downwards.

Each cookbook filename must be a valid Python module name, hence all lowercase, with underscore if that improves
readability and that doesn't start with a number.

Given that the cookbooks are imported dynamically, a broader set of characters like dashes and starting with a number
are technically allowed and the current standard at WMF is to name the cookbooks with dashes instead of underscores.

Example of cookbooks tree::

    cookbooks
    |-- __init__.py
    |-- top-level-cookbook.py
    |-- group1
    |   |-- __init__.py
    |   `-- important-cookbook.py
    `-- group2
        |-- __init__.py
        `-- subgroup1
            |-- __init__.py
            `-- some-task.py

API interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each cookbook must follow one of the two available API interfaces:

* `Class interface`_ (preferred)
* `Module interface`_

Class interface
"""""""""""""""

A more integrated class-based API interface. Each cookbook must define two classes that extends
:py:class:`spicerack.cookbook.CookbookBase` and :py:class:`spicerack.cookbook.CookbookRunnerBase` respectively,
defining the required abstract methods and optionally overriding the default implementation of the concrete ones.

The Spicerack framework will instantiate the class derived from ``CookbookBase`` passing to it an initialized
:py:class:`spicerack.Spicerack` instance. Then it will call its ``argument_parser`` method to get the ``argparse``
instance and with that parse the CLI arguments. After that it will call the ``get_runner`` method that must return
an instance of a class derived from ``CookbookRunnerBase``. The ``runtime_description`` property will be used to
customize the default ``START``/``STOP`` IRC messages. Up to this point any exception raised will be considered a
pre-failure and make the cookbook fail before IRC-logging its start.

Then the ``run`` method will be called to actually run the cookbook.

If the ``run`` method returns a non-zero exit code or raises any exception the optional ``rollback`` method will be
called to allow the cookbook to perform any cleanup action. Any exception raised by the ``rollback`` method will be
logged and the cookbook will exit with a reserved exit code.

The derived classes can have any name and multiple cookbooks in the same module are supported.

Module interface
""""""""""""""""

A simple function-based API interface for the cookbooks in which each cookbook is a Python module that defines the
following constants and functions.

.. module:: cookbook-module

.. attribute:: __title__

   A module attribute that defines the cookbook title. It must be a single line string.

   :type: str

.. function:: argument_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser:

   Optional module function to define if the cookbook should accept command line arguments.

   If defined the returned argument parser will be used to parse the cookbook's arguments.

   If not defined it means that the cookbook doesn't accept any argument and if called with arguments it's considered
   an error.

   Cookbooks are encouraged to define an ``argument_parser()`` function so that an help message is automatically
   available with ``-h/--help`` and it can be shown both when running a cookbook directly or in the interactive menu.

   :returns: the argument parser instance.
   :rtype: argparse.ArgumentParser

.. function:: run(args, spicerack)

   Mandatory module function with the actual execution of the cookbook.

   :param args: the parsed arguments that were parsed using the defined ``argument_parser()`` module function or
        :py:data:`None` if the cookbook doesn't support any argument.
   :type args: argparse.Namespace or None
   :param spicerack: the Spicerack accessor instance with which the cookbook can access all the Spicerack capabilities.
   :type spicerack: spicerack.Spicerack
   :returns: the return code of the cookbook, it should be zero or :py:data:`None` on success, a positive integer
        smaller than ``128`` and not in the range ``90-99`` (see :ref:`Reserved exit codes<reserved-codes>`) in case of
        failure.
   :rtype: int or None

Logging
^^^^^^^

The logging is already pre-setup by the ``cookbook`` entry point script that initialize the root logger, so that each
cookbook can just initialize its own :py:mod:`logging` instance and log. A special logger to send notification to the
``#wikimedia-operations`` IRC channel with the ``!log`` prefix is also available through the ``spicerack`` argument,
passed to the cookbook's ``run()`` function for the module API or available in the cookbook class as ``self.spicerack``
for the class API, in its ``irc_logger`` property. The ``irc_logger`` logs to both IRC and the nomal log outputs of
Spicerack. If the dry-run mode is set it does not log to IRC.
The log files can be found in `/var/log/spicerack/${PATH_OF_THE_COOKBOOK}` on the host where the cookbooks are run.
All normal log messages are sent to two separate files, of which one always logs at ``DEBUG`` level even if
``-v/--verbose`` is not set.
So for example running the cookbook ``foo.bar.baz`` will generate two log files::

    /var/log/spicerack/foo/bar/baz.log  # with INFO and higher log levels
    /var/log/spicerack/foo/bar/baz-extended.log  # with all log levels

If the cookbook is started with a directory of multiple cookbooks then the logs are all concentrated in the directory
path ones::

    /var/log/spicerack/foo/bar.log  # with INFO and higher log levels
    /var/log/spicerack/foo/bar-extended.log  # with all log levels

Example of logging::

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    logger.info('message')  # this goes to stdout in the operator shell and is logged in both files.
    logger.debug('message') # this goes to stdout in the operator shell only if -v/--verbose is set and is logged only
                            # in the extended file.

    def run(args, spicerack):
        spicerack.irc_logger.info('message')  # This sends a message to the #wikimedia-operation IRC channel with:
                                              # !log user@host message

Spicerack library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the available modules in the Spicerack package are exposed to the cookbooks through the ``spicerack`` instance
injected in the cookbook. It offers helper methods to obtain initialized instances of all the available libraries.
This instance exposes also some of the global CLI arguments parsed by the ``cookbook`` entry point script such as
``dry_run`` and ``verbose`` as getters. See :py:class:`spicerack.Spicerack` for more details.

Exception handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In general each module in the :py:mod:`spicerack` package has its own exception class to raise specific errors, and
all of them are derived from the base class :py:class:`spicerack.exceptions.SpicerackError`.

.. _reserved-codes:

Reserved exit codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cookbook exit codes in the range ``90-99`` are reserved by Spicerack and must not be used by the cookbooks.
The currently defined reserved exit codes are documented in the :py:mod:`spicerack.cookbook` module.
